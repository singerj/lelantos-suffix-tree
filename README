There are two possibilities to install the suffix tree version of Lelantos.

By executing the script "install_makefile" SeqAn-2.0.0 is downloaded and the
suffix_tree_mapping binary is build using "Makefile".

The second option is to call the script "install_cmake". Again, first
SeqAn-2.0.0 is downloaded. However, this time the script uses the cmake build
system of SeqAn in order to generate the binary.
